If you are using an unsupported ESP32 board you will need to complie a board template. 
Templates provide an easy way to create, modify and share pin configurations for any type of board you have without the need to modify the firmware. 
On the config dashboard you can go to the advanced options and fill the Board Template field with your custom template. If you want to go back to use the default boards, leave this field completely empty.

CREATE YOUR OWN TEMPLATE 

The board templates have the following format: 

{"name":"[433] Heltec LoRa V1","aADDR":60,"oSDA":4,"oSCL":15,"oRST":16,"pBut":0,"led":25,"radio":1,"lNSS":18,"lDIO0":26,"lDIO1":12,"lBUSSY":0,"lRST":14,"lMISO":19,"lMOSI":27,"lSCK":5,"lTCXOV":0.0}

name: Give a name to your board
aADDR: I2C address of the OLED display (in decimal format)
oSDA: OLED SDA pin
oSCL: OLED SCL pin
oRST: OLED RST pin
pBut: GPIO used for the board user button
led: GPIO used for the main board indicator led
radio: Type of radio module user by your board 0: sx166x, 1: sx127x
lNSS: LoRa NSS pin
lDIO0: LoRa DIO0 pin
lDIO1: LoRa DIO1 pin
lBUSSY: LoRa BUSY pin
lRST: LoRa RST pin
lMISO: LoRa MISO pin
lMOSI: LoRa MOSI pin
lSCK: LoRa SCK pin
lTCXOV: LoRa TXCO voltage (float value, only used for sx126x modules)
